    <h1>Contacting Me</h1>
    <hr class="head" />        
    
    
    <p>Unfortunately, I get more email than I can handle everyday.  As a result, with high probability, I only respond to emails from people I know, or from people who have read this page.  <b>If we aren't already acquainted, please read the following before emailing me.</b> <br/><br/>

        <b>Looking to join our faculty?</b> You can find information on our open positions <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/engage/join-us/faculty-positions-available/" target="_blank">here</a>, and if you have further questions, you can contact our Associate Provost (effectively the department chair) Azer Bestavros at best@bu.edu or our Director of Administration Chris Devits at cdevits@bu.edu. Applications are reviewed by committee.  After candidates have received an interview, I am happy to talk to them about my experience at BU.  I also have a blog post about my experience on the <a href="blog/job-market.html">job market</a> which may be helpful. <br/><br/>
        <!-- but unfortunately, I get too many requests to be able to talk to applicants before that point.-->
        
          <!--<b>Looking for a summer internship or RA position?</b> I do not take on interns, and I only hire BU students for funded RA positions. <br/><br/>
      If/when I have a post-doc position to fill, I will post ads in appropriate venues (e.g. the sigecom mailing list). 
        Otherwise, my answer will be sorry, but no.-->

        <b>Prospective visiting scholar or postdoc?</b> 
        If our research interests are close enough that I have cited your work or you have cited mine, please include specific information about that in your email.  <br/><br/>       

        <b>Questions about my research?</b> Like most academics, I love to discuss my research with someone who is building on my work. If you have a question about one of my papers, one of my projects, or a resource I've made available, please email me!  For any paper of mine that is behind a pay-wall, it is also available from my website for free. <br/><br/>

        <b>Prospective PhD student?</b> For general questions about the PhD program in Computing &amp; Data Sciences, please first read our <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/programs/phd-degree/" target="_blank">webpage</a>. If your question isn't answered there, please contact cds-admissions@bu.edu. Please note that PhD admissions at CDS are done centrally by committee at the department level, and not by specific faculty members.  Many more details about working with me as a PhD student are available <a href="prospective-students.html">here</a>. <br/><br/>
        
         <b>Prospective undergraduate student?</b> For general questions about the Bachelors degree in Data Science,  please first read our <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/academics/undergraduate/" target="_blank">webpage</a>. If your question isn't answered there, please contact CDS Advising at cds-advising@bu.edu. <br/><br/>
         
         <b>Questions about undergraduate research?</b> See information <a href="prospective-students.html#ugrad-research">here</a>. <br/><br/>

        <b>Looking to hire CDS students?</b> You can contact our Director of Administration Chris Devits at cdevits@bu.edu to have him advertise your job posting assuming it is a reasonable fit. <br/><br/>
        
        <b>Looking to partner with CDS?</b> CDS has an amazing program called <a href="https://www.bu.edu/spark/" target="_blank">BU Spark!</a> which offers courses that are practicums, as well as internships and partnerships with industry practitioners.  If you are looking to build a partnership with CDS, to potentially host CDS interns or otherwise, you can contact the Director of BU Spark! Ziba Cranmer at zcranmer@bu.edu. <br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Questions about a former experience of mine?</b>  <!--As much as I've loved my former affiliations and experiences, I lack the time to answer questions about them now.  I suggest you reach out to their current affiliates instead.  Also, for any kind of applicant, I suggest you simply apply and wait to reach out with questions about experiences until you are admitted/short-listed, as time is a precious commodity, and the people whose time you are asking for will appreciate it if you acknowledge that.<br/><br/>
        UW or Columbia, or | You may, however, -->
        Rather than email me, I'd prefer that you request/suggest a blog post on a specific topic <a href="https://forms.gle/K1VME2wBKzETpQno7" target="_blank">here</a> and include some specific questions or your email address in the suggestion, and if I write the post, I may follow up with you to see if you have other questions.<br/><br/>

        <!--Have a cool idea for a start-up using AGT? My consulting fee is $200/hr. I do not "grab coffee" or "jump on the phone". <br/><br/-->
