    <h1>Growth Rates</h1>
    <hr class="head" />
    <p>Conclusion: Growth is exponential, with precise growth rates varying by country and depending on containment measures.  Without containment, the doubling rate is 1-6 days varying by country.  It's approximately 2 days in the US.<ul>

    <h1>Estimating "True" Cases</h1>
    <hr class="head" />
    <p>Conclusion: While we are aware of ~2800 cases in the US, due to lack of testing, lack of insurance, and the government's delay in taking it seriously, a conservative estimate for the number of "true" cases is at least 12x the current number, or 33,600 cases.<ul>

    <h1>Infection Rates, Severity, and Medical Care</h1>
    <hr class="head" />
    <p>Conclusion: Age or weakened immune system increases fatality rates.  However, <strong>infection rates are high for younger ages too, and 12&ndash;20&#37; of those infected need hospitalization/oxygen.</strong>  Healthcare systems cannot accommodate this!  (See the Italy testimonials.) <br/><br/>

    <h1>Impact of Social Distancing</h1>
    <hr class="head" />
    <p>Conclusion: In order to not be in need of medical care when the system is overwhelmed in 9-14 days, you need to not get infected TODAY.  <ul>

    <h1>COVID-19 Symptoms &amp; When to Seek Medical Care</h1>
    <hr class="head" />
    <p>Conclusion: The primary symptoms are fever, dry cough, fatigue, phlegm, and shortness of breath.  Unless your symptoms are fully consistent and are severe, and/or you have pre-existing conditions that elevate your risk, you will almost definitely be told to treat your illness from home.  STAY HOME for fourteen days except if to receive medical care.  If your symptoms become more severe or your risk is higher, CALL a doctor, urgent care facility, or emergency room to discuss your case and whether or not you should come in to get tested.  (And whether they have the capacity to test you or you need to go elsewhere.)<ul>

    <h1>Testimonials on Costs of Testing</h1>
    <hr class="head" />
    <p>Conclusion: In the US, it has cost as much as $500 with insurance or $1700 without.  Recently, the head of the CDC promised to cover the cost of testing regardless of insurance.  It is unclear when this would go into effect.<ul>

    <h1>Success of Containment Measures in Other Countries</h1>
    <hr class="head" />
    <p>Conclusion: Major efforts in testing and containment can slow the spread and prevent the medical system from being overwhelmed.  This can be seen in the growth rate section as well.<br/><br/>
