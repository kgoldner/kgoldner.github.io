    <h1>Diversity, Inclusion, and Societal Good</h1>
    <hr class="head" />        
    
    
    <p>I firmly believe that part of my job is to improve my community and society at large.  I believe that an academic community is stronger when a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives are represented.  I believe that <b>all</b> people should have the opportunity to participate in, contribute to, and enhance the computer science community independent of their race, their gender, their socioeconomic status, the country of their birth, or anything else.<br/><br/>
    To this end, I participate in several activities.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments about any of them. <br/><br/>
    <b>Mentoring: </b> I am very proud to work with and mentor (in some small part) several fantastic students.  I have also participated in many formal mentoring programs.
