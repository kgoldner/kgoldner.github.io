        <p>Halfway through my fourth year as faculty, I thought I'd write one more part to share some job-market-related things I've learned from the "other side."  I've been on the search committee two of the past three years, and involved with hiring in some way every year, both in my department and others.  TL;DR: No one is out to get you.  For anything not going your way, it's probably due to people being busy or bureaucracy.  And there are probably people working very hard for you behind the scenes regardless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="job-market.html#partIV">read more &raquo; </a><br/><br/><br/>

<span style="font-family: 'Titillium Web', sans-serif; font-size: 140%;"><b>On Postdocs</b> &middot; June 13, 2023</span> </p>

        <p>Many people say that a postdoc should be the best time of your academic career, and they're half-right.  But there are a lot of things about being a postdoc that are extremely difficult that aren't widely talked about.  I think a lot of these can be mitigated with awareness and planning.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="on-postdocs.html">read more &raquo; </a><br/><br/><br/>
        
        <span style="font-family: 'Titillium Web', sans-serif; font-size: 140%;"><b>Travel Tips</b> &middot; June 8, 2023</span> </p>

        <p>As academics, we travel a lot. (If you haven't, trust me, there's comes a point where you will.)  It's for sure fun some of the time, but it creates friction in your life, so it's nice to master some components that makes it all a lot easier.  A friend's mom once overheard my Whatsapp voice message to her with some of my travel advice and thought it was a podcast, so, those are my credentials here.  Plus ~8 years of airline status, and living a fairly nomadic lifestyle in graduate school involving a lot of travel.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="travel-tips.html">read more &raquo; </a><br/><br/><br/>
         
         <span style="font-family: 'Titillium Web', sans-serif; font-size: 140%;"><b>Living with Invisible Pain</b> &middot; May 20, 2023</span> </p>

        <p>Many people live with some sort of ongoing invisible pain or struggle. I thought I would write about my own journey. 
    
        Migraines are debilitating "headaches" from which 14%
         of the world's population suffers, and 2%
         suffer from "chronic migraines," meaning they have migraines at least 15 days a month [<a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/migraine-facts/" target="_blank">AMF</a>].  I am sad to say I am part of this unfortunate 2%,
         and I thought I would talk a bit about my experience, as well as some of my techniques for coping, in case there are others struggling with chronic migraines as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="migraines.html">read more &raquo; </a><br/><br/><br/>
        
<span style="font-family: 'Titillium Web', sans-serif; font-size: 140%;"><b>Every Academic Needs a Website</b> &middot; July 26, 2022</span> </p>

        <p>As I wrote in a twitter thread last week: "If you're an academic without a website, you don't exist. Doesn't matter if you haven't published yet, put up a website with your name, affiliation, EMAIL, advisor, research interests, and photo. Otherwise you can't be found." Today, I'll elaborate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="websites.html">read more &raquo; </a><br/>
