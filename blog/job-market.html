    <h1>The Job Market (Part I)</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 80%;">September 28, 2021</p>   <a href="https://onak.pl/" target="_blank"> </a>
    
        <p><span class="attn">Note: I'm happy to edit and polish this over time, so feel free to send me questions or comments.</span><br/><br/>
        
        I was on the faculty job market this past year, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic and while everything was on zoom, and am writing this about my experience in response to many questions that I've gotten, not because I think I am any kind of expert.<br/><br/>
        
        I was hoping to write an all-encompassing post, but time keeps passing, so I'll start with the parts that are relevant now and update with more later so as not to miss out on this year's cycle.<br/><br/>

My first suggestion, which isn't much use to just say, is that being on the job market is a year of constant decision-making and being placed in stressful positions.  People tend to start from a place of anxiety and consulting their friends and mentors about every little thing, and eventually wind up in a semi-numb/zen place where they toss off emails, take meetings, and give talks like it's no big deal.  The sooner you can get to that independent and zen place, the better, because the year is really just a perpetual state of people throwing insane-situation darts at you, so it's time to become impervious to it and learn to just enjoy the chaos.  It sort of reminds me of electrical stimulation during physical therapy&mdash;when you have a really painful injury, they electrically stimulate your nerves.  At first it's uncomfortable and even slightly painful as they increase the frequency to stimulate the nerves of your injury which are overworked, but eventually, they're so stimulated that they finally go numb and rest and you get some relief, and it's kind of the best thing ever.  That's where we need to get to&mdash;past that initial anxiety stimulation and to the rest and relief.<br/><br/>

One of the first things you learn as new faculty is that no one really knows what they're doing.  Think about it: if you're on the job market, you're going to be faculty in a few short months.  People start teaching immediately, advising, and get asked to be on admissions and hiring committees.  There's no separate training for that.  That's you in a few month's time.  That could be you right now if you'd gone on the market last year.  So who's on the other side of your process?  You, effectively.  Pretty much the best thing you can do whenever you start stressing and asking yourself questions about every small thing is imagine you're on the other side.  What would you care about if you were hiring?  Would you decide whether to hire someone because they wore a blue vs. pink shirt, or skipped a glass of wine at dinner?  No, I don't think so, so you don't need to stress about that.  What would you look for in a colleague?  Giving yourself this mental check has given me a new level of zen whenever I interact with anyone, apply for anything, etc.<br/>

<h3>My timeline:</h3>

Part of this will be non-standard due to COVID, and also, I didn't necessarily do a good job (which I'll try to point out), but might be a helpful reference.

<ul>
<li><b>April-August:</b> Was anxious about the job market and asked questions about how to prepare to my mentors and they kept telling me it was too early, to just do research and relax.  This was good advice.</li>
<li><b>Aug 1:</b> started making sure my website really comprehensive</li>
<li><b>Aug 11:</b> My advisor suggested that I give a few research area seminars in the fall</li>
<li><b>Aug 24:</b> I started really considering my service load for the year and making sure not to take on too much</li>
<li><b>Aug 27:</b> My advisor and I settled on some seminars and reached out to organizers</li>
<li><b>Sept 4:</b> I first discussed letter writers with my advisor</li>
<li><b>Sept 7:</b> rising stars apps due?</li>
<li><b>Sep 13-23:</b> First attempts at research and teaching statements (mostly because of applications to "Rising Stars")</li>
<li><b>Sept 21:</b> Gave first seminar talk, included full day of one-on-ones (which people in my research area), which was great practice for an interview.</li>
<li><b>Sept 23:</b> SigECOM job market profiles were due, which is an aggregation of people on the job market in my research area.  Make sure you get on these if they exist in your area!</li>
<li><b>Oct 23-27:</b> Decided on and asked letter writers (advised by PhD advisor and postdoc host).  <span class="attn">This was late.  Ask for letters and work on statements closer to Sept 15.</span></li>
<li><b>Oct 26-Nov 4:</b> Major work on statements.  Also started canceling research meetings to focus on job market things.</li>
<li><b>Nov 5-6:</b> Submitted my first applications.  Note that adjusting cover letters and uploading documents still takes a surprising amount of time, so even though I started on the 5th, it took two days to finish my first batch.  <span class="attn">This was late, both for Israel and the OR market.  They really should have been in by October 15.</span></li>
<li><b>Nov 8-11:</b> Informs&mdash;must attend if on the OR market, and should have OR applications in beforehand.</li>
<li><b>Nov 9-10:</b> Rising Stars in EECS, a fantastic workshop for women in EECS.  Many attend <i>before</i> the year that they're on the market.  I highly recommend waiting until you're on the market, because they actually give feedback on statements and talk intros and give advice for intros which will not be useful if you're not actually on the job market.</li>
<li><b>Nov 25:</b> First OR screening call (until Dec 14).</li>
<li><b>Dec 18:</b> First US CS Screening call (until Jan 19).</li>
<li><b>Dec 31:</b> First Israel Interview (until Feb 2).  These were a bit later than typical because of my late applications.</li>
<li><b>Jan 15:</b> First OR interview.  I delayed this about a week due to existing Israel interviews.</li>
<li><b>Jan 19:</b> First rejection email.</li>
<li><b>Jan 21:</b> First US CS interview (until March 11).  I scheduled these as early as possible to try to align with the Israel and OR markets, so they were a bit earlier than usual.</li>
<li><b>Feb 1:</b> First Israel offer (until Feb 17), made formal Feb 18, one month deadline.</li>
<li><b>Feb 1:</b> First OR offer, made formal Feb 14, 3 week deadline.  </li>
<li><b>Feb 9:</b> First US CS offer (until March 27).  The first <i>formal</i> CS offer letter I received was on March 35, though.  The shortest deadline I had was two weeks, which eventually got extended to three.  These were for three different schools.</li>
<li><b>March 15:</b> First second visit (until April 7).</li>
<li><b>April 9:</b> Date of my decision.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiple Markets</h3>
I applied to three different markets: the North American Computer Science market (which I'll just refer to as the US CS market, or just CS, since I only actually applied to one school in Canada), the Operations Research (OR) market, and the Israel (Computer Science) market.  Each market has slightly different timing and traditions, so I sought advice from people within each market.  It's important to do this earlier on so that so that it's clear that you respect the market and really want to be a part of it. <br/><br/>

For example, if you are going on the OR market, you need to attend Informs, the big annual OR conference.  The year of the job market, you give a talk and everyone interested in hiring you should come see it.  You also have interviews at Informs.  In order to prepare for this process, it's best if you attend Informs a previous year to understand what this event looks like, because it's definitely not your typical CS conference.  Also, it's a journal field, so it's important to separate out your journal publications into a different section on your CV, and you'll certainly be asked questions about this. <br/><br/>

My letter writers for the Israeli market were not the same as my letter writers for the US CS market.  I was told that seniority is much more important in the Israeli market, as opposed to perhaps the person who knows you and your work the best and thinks the highest of you, even if they're more junior, so I only used my most senior letter writers.  In Israel, I emailed my contacts <i>before</i> applying and asked about the process, whereas everywhere else I just emailed my contacts after submitting my applications. <br/><br/> 

Plus, for any market that's different from where you are currently, you're sure to be asked why you want to join.  Why do you want to move to Israel?  Why do you want to be in an OR department?  And you better have a good reason, because no one wants to give away their precious slots to someone who doesn't really want to be there.  For example: My work is interdisciplinary, but I don't have as much experience with the applied, so I'd love to be in an OR department to have more applied collaborators with their connections to be able to get my research more connected to practice.  And, I'd love to live in Israel because all of the time I've spent there has been some of my happiest, plus it's a million times easier to implement allocation systems with the government, and it's the greatest academic hub of all, even more so than New York or Boston or the Bay area. <br/><br/>



<h3>Where to apply and getting organized</h3>
Pretty much all CS-related faculty positions are posted on the <a href="https://cra.org/ads/" target="_blank"><b>CRA job page</b></a>, and the best thing to do is to subscribe to the email list by filling out the right side of that website, and then take note of the relevant job ads as they come in.  Sometimes there are more specific aggregations, e.g., <a href="https://cstheory-jobs.org/" target="_blank">CS theory jobs</a>.  For operations research and industrial engineering departments, many posted on the CRA job page regardless, but I also specifically went looking for postings at the schools that have more engineering departments (compared to business schools).  For me, these schools are: Cornell ORIE, Georgia Tech ISyE, Stanford MS&amp;E, Columbia IEOR, Northwestern IEMS, Michigan IEOR, and in Israel, Technion IE&amp;M. <br/><br/>

Another great resource is the <b>"Future Faculty Forum" slack channel</b> created by Supreeth Shastri.  To join, email him at supreeth-shastri@uiowa.edu.  This is a closed community only of this year's academic candidates formed to help each other out gathering job listings and answering one another's questions as they go through the job market experience together.  Sometimes sub-communities form as well&mdash;for example, I was in a 9-person "2021-israel" channel that I found extremely valuable for candidates searching in Israel. <br/><br/>

As for <i>choosing</i> from the list of schools that have postings.  The first thing to note is that if a posting lists a preferred area within a larger posting, even if that's not your area, you can apply anyway.  However, if the posting specifically says "Assistant Professor of Computational Neuroscience" and is entirely geared toward that, then you really need to be a computational neuroscientist.  Otherwise, I think my list narrowed naturally.  I think in my head, I was considering location, quality of students at the school, known colleagues within and outside of the department, etc, and if something fell too low in various categories then it got nixed.  I wound up making a spreadsheet with the following columns: University, Department, Link [to application], Deadline	 [for application], Submitted?, Updatable?, Letters, Preference, Notes, Contact, Emailed?. <br/>

<ul>
<li>"Updatable" was something that came up later&mdash;after I found embarrassing typos in my cover letter, or wanted to add something to my CV, or whatever.  Some of the applications are updatable, and if so, note it and save the link as to where you can update!</li>

<li>"Preference" was not a total-ordering of the schools or anything.  It was a rough sorting of the various positions into tiers.  I think there were about 6 schools ranked "1" and 0 schools ranked "3" if this gives you an idea of the coarseness.</li>

<li>"Notes" was where I noted what was <i>different</i> about this application or process.  E.g., one school wanted a "service statement."  </li>

<li>"Contact" was someone in my subfield, preferably who I already knew, who I could email after having submitted my application so they could make sure it didn't fall through the cracks.</li>

<li>"Letters" contained information about how many letters of recommendation the school requested, whether they asked for the letters directly or just names of letter writers, links to check on the uploaded letters (these links are extremely important!!), etc.</li>
</ul>

Timing: I think OR postings mostly went up in early September.  CS postings went up any time between early September and mid-to-late November, so be patient.  Israeli university websites got updated sometime between September and October.

<h3>Application materials</h3>
One of the most important things I was told is that there's a point after which it's not worth tuning your statements anymore.  They're good enough, and you're wasting your time, so just stop.  I think 2-3 weeks of full-time focus (application materials are your main object throughout the day, even if your doing some other things) should be plenty, and any longer will drive you insane.<br/><br/>

Going back to the principle of "what would I do on the other side?"&mdash;how would you judge an applicant?  Would you care that much about their CV or the descriptions on page 4 of their research statement?  Would you care at all about the specific LaTeX template they used?  You'd probably mostly care about what their letter writers say, read the introduction of their research statement closely to see what their field is, how much it excites you, and what their contribution is, and at most skim other materials.  So create your materials with this in mind!  This is why there's a "good enough" threshold, because really you can express your field and contributions clearly, and it's up to your letter writers to do the rest.  Here are some tips I've heard:
<ul>
<li>The length of your research statement should be 3-5 pages.  Don't go overboard.  Make sure the introduction/first page of your research statement is incredibly solid.  This is the most important part.  It should make your area exciting, mention your contributions, and be easy to skim.  There should be an easy sentence take-away for the committee of who you are that they can take to everyone else to convince them to interview you.  The rest of your statement should describe your work so far and your future work, but the whole thing should be forward-focused, because what they're looking for is <i>research vision</i>.</li>
<li>If you have trouble writing strongly about your work, think about it as writing about how cool your field is instead, and explaining that to people who don't know about it, and then just adding that you've made major contributions to it.</li>
<li>Teaching statements should contain teaching philosophy, course plans, experience, and thoughts on advising.  They should be at most 2 pages.</li>
<li>Diversity statements should talk about your diversity and inclusion work and thoughts.  They should be at most 2 pages.  (These are not a thing in Israel.)</li>
</ul>
